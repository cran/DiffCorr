Description: A method for identifying pattern changes between 2
    experimental conditions in correlation networks (e.g., gene
    co-expression networks), which builds on a commonly used association
    measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. This package
    includes functions to calculate correlation matrices for
    high-dimensional dataset and to test differential correlation, which
    means the changes in the correlation relationship among variables
    (e.g., genes and metabolites) between 2 experimental conditions.
