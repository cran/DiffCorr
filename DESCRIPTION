Description: A method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental
         conditions in correlation networks (e.g., gene co-expression networks),
         which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's
         correlation coefficient. This package includes functions to calculate
         correlation matrices for high-dimensional dataset and to test
         differential correlation, which means the changes in the correlation
         relationship among variables (e.g., genes and metabolites) between 2
         experimental conditions.
